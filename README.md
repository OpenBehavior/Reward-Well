## Open Source Design for Liquid Reward in Rodent Behavioral Mazes

Infrared-beam activated, liquid-reward system for behavioral mazes.

Designed by: The Kemere Lab (PI: Caleb Kemere. caleb.kemere@rice.edu)

The reward-well system is designed to ensure precise and reliable reward delivery; they are designed to be placed at the ends of a behavioral maze track. Interruption of the infrared beams on correct trials will trigger the system to deliver a liquid reward. This can be achieved using either a pump or a valve-controlled gravity-feed system. This design was validated through FDM printing (PLA). Additional mouse-scale designs can be found at the Kemere Lab Github.
